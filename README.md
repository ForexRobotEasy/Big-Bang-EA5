## Code Overview
The Big Bang EA5 code is an Expert Advisor (EA) written in MQL5. It utilizes various libraries to implement trading strategies based on the SAR trend indicator. The primary trading algorithm follows and capitalizes on trends identified by the SAR indicator.

The code includes global variables for lot size, stop loss, and take profit. It also includes necessary libraries such as Trade, MovingAverages, and TrendByAngle.

The Expert Advisor has the following main functions:
1. `OnInit()`: Initializes the EA and sets trade parameters such as the magic number and deviation for trade execution.
2. `OnDeinit()`: Deinitializes the EA and performs any necessary cleanup.
3. `OnTick()`: Executes trades based on the SAR trend strategy. It checks the current SAR value and opens long or short positions accordingly.
4. `OptimizeTradingPerformance()`: Custom function to optimize the trading performance of the software.
5. `CustomizeInputs()`: Custom function to customize software inputs.
6. `TestEfficiency()`: Custom function to test the software's efficiency on different currency pairs.
7. `EnableScalping()`: Custom function to enable scalping by developing necessary trading functions.
8. `FollowAndCapitalizeOnTrends()`: Custom function to follow and capitalize on trends using the SAR strategy.
9. `OnStart()`: Entry point of the EA. It implements the SAR trend trading strategy, optimizes trading performance, customizes inputs, tests efficiency, and enables scalping.
